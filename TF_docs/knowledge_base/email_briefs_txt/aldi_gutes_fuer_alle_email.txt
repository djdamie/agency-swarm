Hi Christian,

Hope you're doing well! We have an exciting new campaign for ALDI that needs your magic touch.

Here's the brief:

**Campaign**: "Gutes für alle" (Good for everyone)
**Budget**: 80k euros for one month, all media excluding TV
**Territory**: Germany
**Term**: 1 month active + 8 months passive use

**Creative Direction**:
We need something that carries the feeling of relief and worry-free-ness, that's also recognizable and sticks in your head. With our protagonist enjoying the ride, the song should carry the imagery and narrating speed as well - it shouldn't be too monotonous.

**Music References**:
We've been exploring some tracks and here's where we stand:
- Spotify playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4VGRYAv8o2hShKaPFufFiv?si=6d8b958847eb438b

Some specific tracks we've discussed:
- "I Get Around" - 40k for 3 months passive use only // 50k for 5 months passive use
- "Hey Ya!" - Rough yes at 40k (6 months passive)
- "Fly Away" - Rough yes (6 months passive)
- "Call Me The Breeze" - Stephen thinks this could work (reduce term to 6 months)
- "Take It Easy" - Under consideration
- "Superfly" - Stephen thinks this could work (reduce term to 6 months)
- "Alright" - 55k

**Keywords**: happy, classic, uplifting, modern, good sunshine, recognizable song, retro

**Genres**: Folk, Pop, Rock, Funk, Soul

Note: The Johnny Cash version will probably not be clearable on master side.

Let me know what you think and when we can discuss options.

Best,
Julia
