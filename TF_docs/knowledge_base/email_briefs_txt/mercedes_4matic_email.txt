Hi Christian,

Long version: https://we.tl/WAYdK0fSbd
und hier der 30er für den musik research, picture with SFX only: 170718_MB_4Matic_30s_1080p

**Client**: Mercedes-Benz
**Campaign**: 4MATIC
**Media**: TV, Online, Cinema
**Budget**: To be discussed
**Territory**: Global

**Creative Direction**:
We're looking for something:
- Classic, calm, emotional
- More like a film score and not like typical advertising music
- A track to enhance the impact of the film and make people feel something
- NOT cheesy or over-the-top emotional or tracks that feel forced

Think cinematic, sophisticated, subtle emotional build. The visuals show the car handling extreme weather conditions with grace - the music should reflect that quiet confidence.

NDA attached for your signature before we can share more details.

Let me know your initial thoughts!

Best,
Stefan
